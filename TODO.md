TODO stuff
==========

- Responsiveness of site is not ok (can scroll horizontally)
- Small screen = links at the bottom are ugly
- small screen = opening menu no longer works
- "Exactly what you need. Nothing less, nothing more." --> the more is displayed ugly

- clicking a link reloads the entire page at the moment
- smaller pages should load faster: don't need all the cruft on jobs/blog/...

- splash screen Html/JS/CSS: replace CSS with C#
