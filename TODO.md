- In Chrome, the splash screen displays some white background (other browsers always display the background image completely)
- Responsiveness of site is not ok (can scroll horizontally on small devices)
- "Exactly what you need. Nothing less, nothing more." --> the more is displayed ugly

- smaller pages should load faster: don't need all the cruft on jobs/blog/...

- splash screen Html/JS/CSS: replace CSS with C#

- layout of the blog posts is not ok

- title aanpassen(als je hover met muis over tabblad in chrome) bvb .net | angular | react | cloud. Check concurrentie
