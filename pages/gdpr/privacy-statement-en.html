        <h2>Privacy Statement Summary</h2>

        <p>This privacy statement explains what information we gather about you, what we use that
        information for and who we give that information to. It also sets out your rights in relation to
        your information and who you can contact for more information or queries.</p>

        <p>Your information will be used in accordance with the consents that you have given, with Act
        of 30 july 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regards to the processing of personal
        data and with European Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
        of 27 April 2016 (entered into force on 25 May 2018) on the protection of natural persons
        with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data
        (GDPR).This Privacy Notice is also intended to assist you in making informed decisions
        when using our website.</p>

        <h2>What this privacy statement covers?</h2>

        <p>This privacy statement sets out how we will collect, handle, store and protect information
        about you when:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>providing services to you or our clients</li>
            <li>you use “our Website” or</li>
            <li>performing any other activities that form part of the operation of our business, as
                described in further detail below.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When we refer to “our Website” or “this Website” in this policy we mean the specific
        webpages of itenium.be.</p>

        <p>This privacy statement also contains information about when we share your personal data
        with other members of the itenium Network and other third parties (for example, our service
        providers).</p>

        <p>In this privacy statement, your information is sometimes called “personal data” or “personal
        information”. We may also sometimes collectively refer to handling, collecting, protecting
        and storing your personal information as “processing” such personal information.</p>

        <h2>What information we collect?</h2>

        <p>In the course of providing services to you or our clients and performing due diligence checks
        in connection with our services (or discussing possible services we might provide), we will
        collect or obtain personal data about you. We may also collect personal data from you when
        you use our Website.</p>

        <p>We may collect or obtain such data because you give it to us (for example in a form on our
        Website), because other people give that data to us (for example your employer or adviser, or
        third party service providers that we use to help operate our business) or because it is publicly
        available.</p>

        <p>We may also collect or obtain personal data from you because we observe or infer that data
        about you from the way you interact with us or others. For example, to improve your
        experience when you use our Website and ensure that it is functioning effectively, we (or our
        service providers) may use cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser) and Web
        beacons which may collect personal data. Additional information on how we use cookies and
        other tracking technologies and how you can control these can be found on our Cookiepolicy.</p>

        <p>The personal data that we collect or obtain may include: your name; age; date of birth;
        gender; e-mail address; telephone number; home address; country of residence; lifestyle and
        social circumstances (for example, your pastimes); family circumstances (for example, your
        marital status and dependents); employment and education details (for example, the
        organization you work for, your job title and your education details); financial and tax-related
        information (for example your income and tax residency); your postings on any blogs,
        forums, wikis and any other social media applications and services that we provide; your IP
        address; your browser type and language; your access times; complaint details; details of how
        you use our products and services; details of how you like to interact with us and other similar
        information.</p>

        <p>The personal data we collect may also include so called ‘sensitive’ or ‘special categories’ of
        personal data, such as details about your: dietary requirements (for example, where itenium
        would like to provide you with lunch during a meeting), health (for example, so that we can
        make reasonable accommodations for you in our buildings, products and services) and sexual
        orientation (for example if you provide us with details of your spouse or partner).</p>

        <p>The types of personal data and special categories of personal data that we collect may vary
        depending on the nature of the services that we provide to you or our client, or how you use
        our Website. In some rare circumstances, we might also gather other special categories of
        personal data about you because you volunteer that data to us or we are required to gather that
        data as a result of legal requirements imposed on us.</p>

        <p>Where we are provided with personal data about you by our client, we use reasonable efforts
        to include clauses into the contract with the client that will require them to comply with the
        privacy laws and regulations relevant to that information; this may include, for example, that
        the client has provided you with notice of the collection (and other matters) and has obtained
        any necessary consent for us to process that information as described in this privacy
        statement.</p>

        <p>We understand the importance of protecting children&#39;s privacy. Our Website and services are
        not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children. It is not our policy to intentionally
        collect or store information about children.</p>

        <h2>How we use information about you?</h2>

        <h3>Use of personal information to provide services to our clients</h3>

        <p>We will use your personal data to provide you or our client with the requested services. As
        part of this, we may also use your personal data in the course of correspondence relating to
        the services. Such correspondence may be with you, our client, other members of the itenium
        Network, our service providers or competent authorities. We may also use your personal data
        to conduct due diligence checks relating to the services. Because we provide a wide range of
        services to our clients, the way we use personal data in relation to our services also varies. For
        example, we might use personal data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>about a client to help him/her complete a tax returnabout a client’s employees to
                contact him during the performance of our services and keep them informed of the
                project’s progress or in order to communicate them our projects’ deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use of personal information for other activities that form part of the operation of our business
        We may also use your personal data for the purposes of, or in connection with:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>applicable legal or regulatory requirements</li>
            <li>requests and communications from competent authorities</li>
            <li>administrative purposes</li>
            <li>financial accounting, invoicing and risk analysis purposes</li>
            <li>client relationship purposes, which may involve: (i) sending you thought leadership or
                details of our products and services that we think might be of interest to you; (ii)
                contacting you to receive feedback on services; and (iii) contacting you for other
                market or research purposes. In all above cases, we give you the opportunity to decline
                our offers and requests at any time. In specific cases if needed, for example in case
                you are not yet a client, we will make sure to obtain your prior consent before sending
                you communications’ materials or other marketing requests (see also below, “The
                legal grounds we use for processing personal information”);</li>
            <li>recruitment and business development purposes (for example testimonials from a
                client’s employees may be used as part of our recruitment and business development
                materials with that employee’s permission)</li>
            <li>services we receive from our professional advisors, such as lawyers, accountants and
                consultants</li>
            <li>protecting our rights and those of our clients.</li>

        <h3>Use of personal information collected via our Website</h3>

        <p>In addition to the purposes connected to the operation of our business above, we may also use
        your personal data collected via our Website:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>to manage and improve our Website</li>
            <li>to tailor the content of our Website to provide you with a more personalised
                experience and draw your attention to information about our products and services that
                may be of interest to you</li>
            <li>to manage and respond to any request you submit through our Website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The legal grounds we use for processing personal information</h2>

        <p>We are required by law to set out in this privacy statement the legal grounds on which we rely
        in order to process your personal data.</p>

        <p>As a result, we use your personal data for the purposes outlined above because : (a) of the
        legal and regulatory obligations that we are subject to, such as keeping records for regulatory
        or tax purposes or providing information to a public body or law enforcement agency or (b)
        the information is required in order to provide our services to you or our client. (c) of our
        legitimate interests in the effective delivery of our services to you or our client; (d) of our
        legitimate interests in the effective and lawful operation of our business so long as such
        interests are not outweighed by your interests;</p>

        <p>To the extent that we process any sensitive personal data relating to you for any of the
        purposes outlined above, we will do so because either: (i) you have given us your explicit
        consent to process that data; (ii) we are required by law to process that data in order to ensure
        we meet our ‘know your client’ and ‘anti-money laundering’ obligations (or other legal
        obligations imposed on us); (iii) the processing is necessary to carry out our obligations under
        employment, social security or social protection law; (iv) the processing is necessary for the
        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or (v) you have made the data public.</p>

        <p>Where we are legally required to obtain your explicit consent to provide you with certain
        marketing materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials where we have
        obtained such consent from you.</p>

        <h2>Who we disclose your information to?</h2>

        <p>In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined in the “How we use information
        about you?” section above, we may disclose details about you to: third parties that provide
        services to us; competent authorities (including courts and authorities regulating us); your
        employer and/or their advisers; your advisers; organizations that help us reduce the incidence
        of fraud and other third parties that reasonably require access to personal data relating to you
        for one or more of the purposes outlined in the “How we use information about you?” section
        above.</p>

        <p>Our Website hosts various blogs, forums, wikis and other social media applications or
        services that allow you to share content with other users (collectively “Social Media
        Applications”). Importantly, any personal information that you contribute to these Social
        Media Applications can be read, collected and used by other users of the application. We have
        little or no control over these other users and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that any
        information that you contribute to any Social Media Applications will be handled in
        accordance with this privacy statement.</p>

        <p>Please note that some of the recipients of your personal data referenced above may be based
        in countries outside of the European Union whose laws may not provide the same level of
        data protection. In such cases, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to
        protect your personal data that comply with our legal obligations. The adequate safeguard
        might be a data transfer agreement with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses
        approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data to third countries.</p>

        <p>We may also need to disclose your personal data if required to do so by law, a regulator or
        during legal proceedings.</p>

        <p>We may share non-personal, de-identified and aggregated information with third parties for
        several purposes, including data analytics, research, submissions, thought leadership and
        promotional purposes.</p>

        <h2>Protection of your personal information</h2>

        <p>We use a range of physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your
        personal data secure, accurate and up to date. These measures include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>education and training to relevant staff to ensure they are aware of our privacy
                obligations when handling personal data</li>
            <li>administrative and technical controls to restrict access to personal data on a ‘need to
                know’ basis</li>
            <li>technological security measures, including fire walls, encryption and anti-virus
                software</li>
            <li>physical security measures, such as staff security passes to access our premises.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal data, the
        transmission of data over the internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. We
        endeavor to protect personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to
        us or by us.</p>

        <h2>How long we keep your information for?</h2>

        <p>We will hold your personal data on our systems for the longest of the following periods: (i) as
        long as is necessary for the relevant activity or services; (ii) any retention period that is
        required by law; or (iii) the end of the period in which litigation or investigations might arise
        in respect of the services.</p>

        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        <p>You have various rights in relation to your personal data. In particular, you have a right to:</p>

                a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such

                contract)</li>
            <li>object to our processing of your personal data.</li>
