    As someone taking their first project as a freelancer I couldn't have been more lucky than
    getting started with itenium. Their experience and willingness to help was a great relief to me.

    When I got into contact with the folks at itenium, I was not that interested in leaving
    my former employer. I would only leave for a project that met all my desired criteria,
    of which there were many. I figured I wouldn't hear back, at least not for a while.
    A week later I had my first interview, three weeks later I signed a contract. It's not
    always easy to find a good project, but they found one for me. They took into account the
    experience and type of project I was looking for specifically and found a great fit for me.

    In a business of faceless middlemen, this was truly an honest and hands-on approach.
    Itenium helped me launch my career to the next level, thanks guys!

    Itenium didn't flinch when I requested a dream job, a well paid challenge with modern technology
    and minimal commute time. Being true-bred software developers themselves, they can instinctively
    sense what's a good opportunity and what's not. They delivered insight into the job market, offered
    choice and advice based on experience, and always paid on time. What more can you expect, in a business
    of faceless middlemen, this was truly an honest and hands-on approach. Itenium helped me launch my
    career to the next level, thanks guys!

    The Itenium team earns my highest recommendation, both as a recruiter as well as colleagues!

    About a year ago, I've decided to make the transition from employee to freelancer.
    It was during that time that the Itenium team helped me in finding my first project as a freelancer.
    Now, after working on this project for quite some time, I can really confirm that the Itenium team did a great job in finding a challenging project with a lot of variety and opportunities to grow in my job.
    Next to this, I've also had the pleasure of working together with some members of the Itenium team on the same project. What I enjoy most in our collaboration is the open communication,
    the people focused attitude and knowing I can rely on Itenium whenever support is needed.
